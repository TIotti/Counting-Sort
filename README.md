The Bitwise Sort is a fast way to look for the same entry key on two given sets.

It relies on mark from which set each key will came from at insert time.

At moment covering the following languages:

[C++](https://github.com/TIotti/bitwise_sort/tree/C++)

[Rust](https://github.com/TIotti/bitwise_sort/tree/rust)

NOTE: Still working on parallel implementations
